# LiteChaCha

##### An Implementation Of The ChaCha20 Stream-Cipher, Made For [***glEEmail***](https://github.com/Matt-and-Gib/gleemail).

This is a basic implementation of the ChaCha20 stream-cipher. I am not an authority with regards to cryptography. I would advise you use a mature and well-tested library such as OpenSSL, LibSodium, or the Crypto library for Arduino if possible, particularly if the application is of any importance.

This program is made to be run on the Arduino Nano 33 IoT. It may work on other microcontrollers, but it should be noted that the processor running this program must be Little-Endian in order to execute properly.

This program is in the public domain for all to use freely.
